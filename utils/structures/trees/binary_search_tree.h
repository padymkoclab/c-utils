/**
 * Implementation a binary search tree
 *
 * A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties −
 *     The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.
 *     The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.
 * Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments; the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree and can be defined as −
 *     left_subtree (keys)  ≤  node (key)  ≤  right_subtree (keys)
 *
 * Support operations:
 *     create binary tree
 *     search in binary tree
 *     delete binary tree
 *     display binary tree
